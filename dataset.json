  "responses":["Domain relational calculus is a type of query language used in database management systems (DBMS) to retrieve data from relational databases. It is a non-procedural query language that is based on mathematical predicate calculus.

  In domain relational calculus, queries are expressed as formulas that define the desired output in terms of a set of variables and a predicate that describes the conditions that must be satisfied by the variables. The variables represent the tuples in the relation, and the predicate specifies the constraints that must be met in order for a tuple to be included in the result set.
  
  The language is based on two types of variables: range variables, which range over the domain of the relation, and bound variables, which are introduced by quantifiers and range over a specified domain. There are two types of quantifiers in domain relational calculus: existential quantifiers and universal quantifiers.
  Existential quantifiers are used to express the existence of a tuple that satisfies a given predicate. For example, a query in domain relational calculus might use an existential quantifier to find all customers who have placed an order foreries a particular product.
  Universal quantifiers are used to express the fact that all tuples in a relation satisfy a given predicate. For example, a query in domain relational calculus might use a universal quantifier to find all customers who have placed an order for every product in a certain category.
